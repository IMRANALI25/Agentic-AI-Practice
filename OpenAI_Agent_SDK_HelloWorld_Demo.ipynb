            "    *   **Description:** Agentic AI can act as an adaptive tutor or coach, tailoring learning paths, providing immediate feedback, identifying knowledge gaps, and generating custom exercises or explanations based on an individual's progress and learning style.\n",
            "    *   **Examples:** An AI tutor that adapts to a student's pace, explains concepts in multiple ways, generates practice problems based on areas of weakness, and simulates real-world scenarios for skill development.\n",
            "    *   **Agentic Aspect:** Assessing student state, dynamic curriculum planning, adaptive content generation, continuous feedback loop.\n",

            "The core applications of Agentic AI herald a transformative shift from reactive AI tools to **proactive, goal-driven collaborators**. They promise to automate complex, multi-step processes, personalize digital experiences to an unprecedented degree, and amplify human capabilities across industries.\n",
            "\n",
            "By endowing AI models with the ability to plan, execute, monitor, and adapt, agentic systems move beyond mere information processing to become **autonomous problem-solvers**. While ethical considerations, safety, and oversight remain critical challenges, the trajectory is clear: Agentic AI is poised to become the operating system of the digital future, enabling greater efficiency, innovation, and tailored experiences across virtually every domain. It marks a leap towards truly intelligent agents that don't just *think* but *do*.\n"
